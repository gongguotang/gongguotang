I am an Associate Professor in Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder.

My group and I work in the areas of *machine learning, optimization, signal processing, data science, and computational imaging*. We are particularly interested in  the design of learning models and optimization algorithms that come with theoretical guarantees and are scalable to large datasets.
