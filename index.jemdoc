I am an Associate Professor in Electrical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines.

My group and I work in the areas of machine learning, optimization, and signal processing. We are particularly interested in  the design of learning models and optimization formulations that come with theoretical guarantees and are scalable to large datasets.
